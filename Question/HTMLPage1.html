                    Most of the network connections between this system and other systems will be via a low earth orbit satellite link.The latency of this connection is approximately 500 milliseconds and the bandwidth of the link is 1.5 Mib/s(mebibits/second).Tune the system so that for all TCP connections:<br />
                    The minimum amount of memory available for buffering per connection is large enough for this latency and bandwidth;<br />
                    The default amount of memory available for buffering per connection is equal to the minimum amount of memory for buffering;<br />
                    The maximum amount of memory available for buffering per connection is equal to 1.5 times the minimum amount of memory available for buffering.<br />

                    This service runs /usr/local/bin/monitoring_app<br />
                    This service starts automatically with the operating system<br />
                    This service must not use more than 10Mb of memory, if it exceeds, it will be terminated<br />
                    Service running information can be viewed by looking at /var/log/messages<br />
                </p>

                <h2>Analyze Application Performance</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a tarball in your root home directory, called appl icat ion .tgz that contains a client-server application.<br />
                    Both the client and server are designed to run on the same system.<br />
                    The client application is designed as a test utility for the server. The client accepts input from the keyboard andsends it to the server. Typing a ctrl-D will terminate the client.<br />
                    The server accepts input from the client and logs it to the file /tmp/application.out.<br />
                    Once it is put into production, the server application will be expected to run for long periods without a restart andduring the course of an average day, will be serving out hundreds of connection requests. The expected amount ofdata to be handled by the server will average around 50 KiB per second. The server will be deployed on a systemwhich has sufficient disk space to handle this data rate and log files will be rotated daily to ensure that diskutilization does not become a concern.<br />
                    Analyze the server application and identify, if any, problematic behavior that it exhibits. Record your answer below.<br />

                <h2>Configure a Module</h2>
                <p>This system will be receiving a hardware upgrade in the form of a SCSl controller and a SCSI tape backup unit. Makesure that the SCSl tape controller module st.ko loads with a default buffer size of 24 KiB. <br />
                You should verify thatwhen the module is loaded the kernel reports the correct buffer size in the kernel ring buffer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Configure Tuned</h2>
                <p>
                    On servera, create a tuned profile with the following requirements:<br />
                    Profile name is rh442<br />
                    The profile inherits from the system's recommended profile<br />
                    The readahead parameter for the disk is 3092KiB<br />
                    The profile remains effective after a restart<br />

                <h2>Configure Slice</h2>
                <p>
                    On servera, create a cgroup slice named rh442 with the following requirements:<br />
                    The slice must be limited to 1024 CPU shares and 256M memory<br />
                    The httpd service should call this slice, and the service should start automatically at boot<br />

                    On servera, there are two Yum repositories providing the ansible-doc package<br />
                    One Yum repository has a better response time than the other.<br />
                    Update the Yum configuration on servera to use the Yum repository with the lowest latency, as follows:<br />
                    http://a.example.com/repo<br />
                    http://b.example.com/repo<br />

                <h2>Minimize Page Table Size and TLB Flushes</h2>
                <p>
                    There are two versions of a program in /root that both allocate a 64 MiB segment of shared memory. Configureyour system so that it can run one or the other of these programs according to the following requirements:<br />
                    The amount of memory consumed by the page tables for the process running the program is minimized<br />
                    Assuming this system is primarily running only this program, TLB flushes are minimized when theprogram is running<br />
                    The configuration changes you make persist across reboots<br />
                    The program hugepage . shm uses SYSV shared memory to allocate the 64 MiB segment of memory. Theprogram hugepage .fs uses a pseudofilesystem to handle the memory allocation.<br />

                    You only need to configure your system to support one or the other program, You do not need to configure yoursystem to support both. You should copy only the program you decide to use into the /usr/local/bin directory.<br />

                    If you choose to support the hugepage.fs program, the pseudofilesystem should be mounted to the directory /bigpages. This filesystem should be automatically mounted after a system reboot. When running thehugepage.fs program, you will be prompted for the name of a file under the mountpoint for your pseudofilesystem: you should use the file /bigpages/memory.<br />

                    Both programs will pause after allocating the shared memory and prompt you to continue when you are ready. Thisis so that you may examine the system while the program is running to confirm that memory is being properlyallocated.<br />
